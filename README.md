# Stabapay

Stabapay is a **Layer 2 Microtransaction system** built on the **Dymension RollApp**, designed to enable **instant tipping, pay-per-second streaming, and in-game micropayments** with minimal fees. 

## Features
- **Batch Transactions**: Reduce transaction costs by bundling multiple payments into a single transaction.
- **Custom Fee Module**: Optimize fees for microtransactions while maintaining high throughput.
- **Instant Tipping**: Send small payments instantly with low fees.
- **Streaming Payments**: Pay content creators per second or per unit of consumption.
- **In-Game Micropayments**: Enable seamless in-game purchases and rewards.

## Target Audience
Stabapay is designed for:
- **Content Creators**: Streamers, musicians, and writers who want to monetize content via micropayments.
- **Game Developers**: Those looking to integrate low-fee in-game transactions.
- **Web3 Platforms**: DApps requiring small, frequent payments without high gas fees.
- **Users in Emerging Markets**: Where high transaction costs make microtransactions infeasible on traditional blockchains.

## Architecture
- **Dymension RollApp**: Utilizes Dymension's RollApp technology for scalability and low latency.
- **Batch Processing Module**: Aggregates multiple microtransactions before committing to the blockchain.
- **Custom Fee Mechanism**: Ensures microtransactions remain cost-efficient.
- **CosmJS Integration**: Supports front-end transaction handling for seamless user experience.
